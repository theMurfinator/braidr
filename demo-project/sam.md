## A Humble Beginning (2)
Samwise Gamgee — gardener, cook, and the most unlikely hero of the Third Age.

1. ==**The Conspiracy Unmasked**== Sam is caught eavesdropping on Gandalf and Frodo at Bag End. Gandalf assigns him as Frodo's companion. "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." Sam has never been beyond Hobbiton. #sam #gandalf #frodo #bag_end #hobbiton
   - His father, the Gaffer: "Don't go getting mixed up in the affairs of wizards"
   - Packing rope — "You'll want it, if you haven't got it"

2. The Old Forest and Tom Bombadil — Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin cut through the Old Forest. The trees are hostile. Old Man Willow traps them. Tom Bombadil rescues them with a song. The Barrow-downs. #sam #frodo #merry #pippin #old_forest #tom_bombadil
   - Tom Bombadil — the Ring has no power over him
   - The Barrow-wight and the ancient swords

## Into the Wild (3)
Sam's world expands beyond anything he imagined. He sees Elves, monsters, and the beauty of Middle-earth.

3. ==**Seeing the Elves**== In the Woody End, Sam sees Wood-elves for the first time — the great desire of his life fulfilled. Gildor's company gives them food and shelter and warnings about the road ahead. #sam #wood_elves #gildor
   - Sam's tears of wonder
   - Gildor's warning: "The wide world is all about you"

4. Rivendell — Sam refuses to be left behind at the Council of Elrond. "You need someone of intelligence on this sort of mission." He is included in the Fellowship of the Ring. #sam #council_of_elrond
   - Sam exploring Rivendell — meeting Bilbo
   - Standing up at the Council — pure loyalty overriding protocol

5. The Mines and the Mirror — Through Moria's darkness and Lothlorien's light. Galadriel shows Sam her Mirror — he sees the Shire devastated, trees cut down, Bag End ruined. He almost turns back. But he stays. #moria #lothlorien #galadriel #mirror #bag_end
   - Sam's rope from the Elves of Lorien
   - The vision of the Shire — choosing the mission over home

## The Ring-bearer's Keeper (4)
After the Fellowship breaks, Sam becomes Frodo's only companion — and his only hope.

6. The Emyn Muil — After the breaking at Amon Hen, Sam nearly drowns chasing Frodo across the river. "I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise." They navigate the razor-sharp rocks of the Emyn Muil. Gollum appears. #amon_hen #sam #frodo #emyn_muil #gollum
   - The cliffs and the rope ("I knew I'd want it!")
   - Catching Gollum — Sam's distrust begins

7. ==**Taming Gollum**== Frodo takes pity on Gollum and makes him swear on the One Ring to guide them to Mordor. Sam watches, suspicious. The uneasy alliance. Smeagol begins to emerge — but Sam sees only treachery. #frodo #gollum #one_ring #mordor #sam
   - Smeagol catching fish, trying to please
   - Sam's stew with herbs — "Po-tay-toes"

8. Ithilien — They pass through the gardens of Ithilien, where Faramir and his Rangers ambush them. Faramir learns about the One Ring. Unlike his brother, he refuses it. "I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway." #ithilien #faramir #rangers #one_ring
   - The oliphaunt — Sam's wonder
   - Sam accidentally reveals Gollum's presence

9. ==**Shelob and the Choice**== Gollum leads them into Shelob's lair. The spider stings Frodo. Sam believes he's dead. He takes the One Ring and Sting, intending to finish the quest alone. Then he hears the orcs: Frodo is alive. #gollum #shelob #frodo #one_ring #sting
   - Fighting Shelob with the Phial and Sting
   - Hearing the orcs: "He isn't dead."

## The Last Mile (3)
The approach to Mount Doom. Sam carries the quest — and Frodo — to the end.

10. The Tower of Cirith Ungol — Sam storms a tower full of Orcs to rescue Frodo. The orcs have already killed each other fighting over Frodo's mithril coat. Sam returns the One Ring. Frodo's flash of possessiveness frightens them both. #sam #orcs #frodo #one_ring
    - Sam wearing the Ring at the gate — orcs flee from his shadow
    - "Give me the Ring" — a moment of Sauron in Frodo's eyes

11. ==**"I Can Carry You"**== The march across the plains of Gorgoroth to Mount Doom. Frodo collapses. He cannot go on. Sam picks him up and carries him up the mountain. "I can't carry it for you, Mr. Frodo. But I can carry you!" #gorgoroth #mount_doom #frodo #sam
    - Throwing away everything unnecessary
    - Sam's vision of a garden — what he'll plant when he gets home
    - Carrying Frodo on his back up the slope

12. ==**The Scouring of the Shire**== The hobbits return to find the Shire under Saruman's control. Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin lead the rebellion. Battle of Bywater. Saruman is killed. Sam replants the Shire with Galadriel's gift — a single mallorn seed and earth from Lorien. #shire #saruman #sam #frodo #merry #pippin #galadriel
    - The hobbits ride in as war veterans — transformed
    - Sam plants the mallorn in the Party Field
    - The most beautiful spring the Shire has ever seen
    - Sam marries Rosie Cotton: "Well, I'm home."
