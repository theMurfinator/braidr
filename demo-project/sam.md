## A Humble Beginning (2)
Samwise Gamgee — gardener, cook, and the most unlikely hero of the Third Age.

1. ==**The Conspiracy Unmasked**== #sam is caught eavesdropping on #gandalf and #frodo at #bag_end. Gandalf assigns him as Frodo's companion. "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." Sam has never been beyond #hobbiton.
   - Sam's love of Elvish stories and songs
   - His father, the Gaffer: "Don't go getting mixed up in the affairs of wizards"
   - The promise that changes everything
   - Packing rope — "You'll want it, if you haven't got it"

2. The Old Forest and Tom Bombadil — #sam, #frodo, #merry, and #pippin cut through the #old_forest. The trees are hostile. Old Man Willow traps them. #tom_bombadil rescues them with a song. The Barrow-downs.
   - The forest closing in
   - Tom Bombadil — the Ring has no power over him
   - Goldberry: "He is."
   - The Barrow-wight and the ancient swords

## Into the Wild (3)
Sam's world expands beyond anything he imagined. He sees Elves, monsters, and the beauty of Middle-earth.

3. ==**Seeing the Elves**== In the Woody End, #sam sees #wood_elves for the first time — the great desire of his life fulfilled. #gildor's company gives them food and shelter and warnings about the road ahead.
   - Sam's tears of wonder
   - Elvish bread and starlight
   - Gildor's warning: "The wide world is all about you; you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out."

4. Rivendell — #sam refuses to be left behind at the #council_of_elrond. "You need someone of intelligence on this sort of mission." He is included in the Fellowship of the Ring.
   - Sam exploring Rivendell — meeting Bilbo
   - Bilbo's poem: "The road goes ever on and on"
   - Standing up at the Council — pure loyalty overriding protocol

5. The Mines and the Mirror — Through #moria's darkness and #lothlorien's light. #galadriel shows #sam her #mirror — he sees the Shire devastated, trees cut down, #bag_end ruined. He almost turns back. But he stays.
   - The fear in Moria — but never faltering
   - Sam's rope from the Elves of Lorien
   - The vision of the Shire — Sharkey's destruction
   - Choosing the mission over home

## The Ring-bearer's Keeper (4)
After the Fellowship breaks, Sam becomes Frodo's only companion — and his only hope.

6. The Emyn Muil — After the breaking at #amon_hen, #sam nearly drowns chasing #frodo across the river. "I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise." They navigate the razor-sharp rocks of the #emyn_muil. #gollum appears.
   - Sam can't swim — Frodo pulls him from the water
   - The cliffs and the rope ("I knew I'd want it!")
   - Catching Gollum — Sam's distrust begins

7. ==**Taming Gollum**== #frodo takes pity on #gollum and makes him swear on the #one_ring to guide them to #mordor. #sam watches, suspicious. The uneasy alliance. Smeagol begins to emerge — but Sam sees only treachery.
   - Gollum's oath on the Precious
   - Smeagol catching fish, trying to please
   - Sam's stew with herbs — "Po-tay-toes"
   - The two Gollums arguing — Sam overhears

8. Ithilien — They pass through the gardens of #ithilien, where #faramir and his #rangers ambush them. Faramir tests them — learns about the #one_ring. Unlike his brother, he refuses it. "I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway."
   - The oliphaunt — Sam's wonder
   - Faramir: "I do not wish to see it destroyed"
   - Sam accidentally reveals Gollum's presence
   - Faramir releases them toward Cirith Ungol

9. ==**Shelob and the Choice**== #gollum leads them into #shelob's lair. The spider stings #frodo. Sam believes he's dead. He takes the #one_ring and #sting, intending to finish the quest alone. Then he hears the orcs: Frodo is alive. Sam must rescue him.
   - Fighting Shelob with the Phial and Sting
   - The weight of the decision — take the Ring and go on alone?
   - Putting on the Ring — the terrible temptation
   - Hearing the orcs: "She's got more than one poison. He isn't dead."

## The Last Mile (3)
The approach to Mount Doom. Sam carries the quest — and Frodo — to the end.

10. The Tower of Cirith Ungol — #sam storms a tower full of #orcs to rescue #frodo. The orcs have already killed each other fighting over Frodo's mithril coat. Sam returns the #one_ring. Frodo's flash of possessiveness frightens them both.
    - Sam wearing the Ring at the gate — orcs flee from his shadow
    - Finding Frodo naked and beaten
    - "Give me the Ring" — a moment of Sauron in Frodo's eyes
    - Dressing as orcs for the march into Mordor

11. ==**"I Can Carry You"**== The march across the plains of #gorgoroth to #mount_doom. #frodo collapses. He cannot go on. #sam picks him up and carries him up the mountain. "I can't carry it for you, Mr. Frodo. But I can carry you!"
    - Throwing away weapons, armor, gear — everything unnecessary
    - The last of the water
    - Sam's vision of a garden — what he'll plant when he gets home
    - Carrying Frodo on his back up the slope

12. ==**The Scouring of the Shire**== The hobbits return to find the #shire under #saruman's control. #sam, #frodo, #merry, and #pippin lead the rebellion. Battle of Bywater. Saruman is killed. Sam replants the Shire with #galadriel's gift — a single mallorn seed and a box of earth from Lorien.
    - The hobbits ride in as war veterans — transformed
    - Frodo refuses to kill: "He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us"
    - Sam plants the mallorn in the Party Field
    - The most beautiful spring the Shire has ever seen
    - Sam marries Rosie Cotton: "Well, I'm home."
