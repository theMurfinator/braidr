<h1>Themes & Motifs</h1><p>The big ideas running through the story. Every scene should serve at least one.</p><h2>Power Corrupts</h2><p>The <a class="wikilink" data-id="note1">One Ring</a> is the ultimate test. But it's not just the Ring — Saruman is corrupted by knowledge, Denethor by despair through the Palantir, Wormtongue by resentment. <strong>The question isn't whether you'll be tempted, but how you respond.</strong></p><h2>The Small and the Humble</h2><p>Tolkien's great inversion: the fate of the world rests not on kings and wizards but on hobbits. "Even the smallest person can change the course of the future." Sam, who has no ambition beyond his garden, is the truest hero.</p><h2>Loss and Passing</h2><p>The victory is bittersweet. The Elves leave Middle-earth. Gandalf leaves. Frodo is too wounded to stay. The world is saved, but the magic goes with it. This is a story about the <em>end</em> of an age.</p><h2>Fellowship and Loyalty</h2><p>The Ring can only be destroyed because of relationships:</p><ul><li>Sam carries Frodo up the mountain</li><li>Aragorn marches to the Black Gate as a distraction</li><li>Merry and Pippin rally the Ents</li><li>Even Gollum — twisted by centuries of isolation — plays his part because of a moment of pity from Bilbo</li></ul><h2>Eucatastrophe</h2><p>Tolkien's term: the sudden turn from disaster to grace. Gandalf at dawn at Helm's Deep. The Eagles at the Black Gate. Gollum falling into the fire. The moment where all seems lost, and then — unexpectedly, undeservedly — salvation.</p>
