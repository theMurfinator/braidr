<h1>Worldbuilding: Middle-earth Geography</h1><p>Key locations and their thematic significance. Each place in Middle-earth has a <em>feeling</em> that should come through in the writing.</p><h2>The Shire</h2><p>English countryside. Green rolling hills, round doors, gardens, ale. Represents innocence, the world worth saving. Must feel real and <strong>specific</strong> — not generic pastoral. Tolkien modeled it on rural Warwickshire.</p><h2>Rivendell</h2><p>The Last Homely House. A place of wisdom, rest, and old beauty. Autumn feeling — golden, fading, a little melancholy. The Elves know their time is ending.</p><h2>Moria</h2><p>Dwarven grandeur gone to ruin. The horror of something ancient and forgotten waking up. Vertical spaces — the shafts, the bridge, the endless stair. Claustrophobia alternating with vertigo.</p><h2>Rohan</h2><p>Anglo-Saxon horse culture. Open grasslands, golden halls, strong simple people. Theoden's court at Edoras on its hill. The feeling of a culture under siege from within (Wormtongue) and without (Saruman).</p><h2>Mordor</h2><p>Industrial wasteland. The anti-Shire. Nothing grows, nothing lives, the air itself is poisonous. Tolkien drew on his WWI experience — the blasted landscapes of the Somme. Must feel <strong>physically oppressive</strong> in the prose.</p><h2>Minas Tirith</h2><p>Seven-tiered city carved from white stone. Beautiful but besieged. The White Tree dead in the courtyard — the kingdom waiting for its king. Think: Constantinople meets Mont Saint-Michel.</p>
