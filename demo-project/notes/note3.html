<h1>Character Arc: Aragorn</h1><p>The reluctant king who must overcome his ancestor's failure.</p><h2>Core Wound</h2><p>Isildur — his direct ancestor — had the chance to destroy the <a class="wikilink" data-id="note1">One Ring</a> and failed. Aragorn carries that shame. He doubts whether the weakness is in his blood.</p><h2>Arc Structure</h2><ul data-type="taskList"><li data-type="taskItem" data-checked="true">Act 1: Hiding — lives as "Strider," a ranger. Refuses his birthright.</li><li data-type="taskItem" data-checked="true">Act 2: Testing — forced into leadership after Gandalf falls. Boromir's death forces him to accept responsibility.</li><li data-type="taskItem" data-checked="true">Act 3: Claiming — takes the Paths of the Dead. Only the true king can command the oathbreakers. He chooses to be king.</li><li data-type="taskItem" data-checked="false">Climax: The coronation — and the moment he bows to the hobbits.</li></ul><h2>Key Relationships</h2><p><strong>Arwen:</strong> The stakes. If he doesn't become king, she sails to the Undying Lands. Her mortality is the price of their love — and his motivation.</p><p><strong>Boromir:</strong> The mirror. Boromir is what Aragorn fears becoming — a good man broken by desperation and the Ring's temptation. Boromir's death is Aragorn's catalyst.</p><p><strong>Gandalf:</strong> The mentor who believes in him before he believes in himself.</p><h2>Writing Notes</h2><p>Aragorn should feel most like a king when he's <em>not</em> trying. The healing hands scene, the way he listens to counsel, the instinct to protect. The crown is just the world catching up to who he already is.</p>
