If he doesn't become king, she sails to the Undying Lands. Her mortality is the price of their love — and his motivation.</p><p><strong>Boromir:</strong> The mirror. Boromir is what Aragorn fears becoming — a good man broken by desperation and the Ring's temptation. Boromir's death is Aragorn's catalyst.</p><p><strong>Gandalf:</strong> The mentor who believes in him before he believes in himself.</p><h2>Writing Notes</h2><p>Aragorn should feel most like a king when he's <em>not</em> trying. The healing hands scene, the way he listens to counsel, the instinct to protect. The crown is just the world catching up to who he already is.</p>
