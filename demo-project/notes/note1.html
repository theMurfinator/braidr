<h1>The One Ring</h1><p>The central MacGuffin and source of all conflict. Created by <a class="wikilink" data-id="note3">Sauron</a> in the fires of Mount Doom to control the other Rings of Power.</p><h2>Properties</h2><ul><li>Invisibility when worn (side effect, not primary purpose)</li><li>Extends the wearer's life unnaturally</li><li>Corrupts the will over time — the longer you carry it, the harder it is to give up</li><li>Responds to Sauron's will — <em>wants</em> to be found</li><li>Can only be destroyed where it was made: the Crack of Doom</li></ul><h2>Key Theme</h2><p>The Ring represents <strong>power that corrupts absolutely</strong>. Every character who encounters it is tested. The hierarchy of resistance:</p><ol><li><strong>Tom Bombadil</strong> — immune (outside the system entirely)</li><li><strong>Sam</strong> — resists easily (no ambition, only love)</li><li><strong>Aragorn</strong> — refuses it (knows his ancestor's weakness)</li><li><strong>Gandalf</strong> — refuses it (knows he'd become a tyrant)</li><li><strong>Galadriel</strong> — refuses it (passes the test)</li><li><strong>Faramir</strong> — refuses it (quality of mercy)</li><li><strong>Frodo</strong> — carries it but ultimately fails at the Crack of Doom</li><li><strong>Boromir</strong> — succumbs to temptation</li><li><strong>Gollum</strong> — totally enslaved</li></ol><h2>Writing Notes</h2><p>The Ring should feel heavier in the prose as the story progresses. Early scenes: Frodo barely notices it. Middle: it's a weight around his neck. Final approach to Mordor: it's crushing him. The physical weight is a metaphor for moral burden.</p>
