<p>The central MacGuffin and source of all conflict. Created by Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom to control the other Rings of Power.</p><h2>Properties</h2><ul><li><p>Invisibility when worn (side effect, not primary purpose)</p></li><li><p>Extends the wearer's life unnaturally</p></li><li><p>Corrupts the will over time — the longer you carry it, the harder it is to give up</p></li><li><p>Responds to Sauron's will — <em>wants</em> to be found</p></li><li><p>Can only be destroyed where it was made: the Crack of Doom</p></li></ul><h2>Key Theme</h2><p>The Ring represents <strong>power that corrupts absolutely</strong>. Every character who encounters it is tested. The hierarchy of resistance:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tom Bombadil</strong> — immune (outside the system entirely)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sam</strong> — resists easily (no ambition, only love)</p></li><li><p><strong>Aragorn</strong> — refuses it (knows his ancestor's weakness)</p></li><li><p><strong>Gandalf</strong> — refuses it (knows he'd become a tyrant)</p></li><li><p><strong>Galadriel</strong> — refuses it (passes the test)</p></li><li><p><strong>Faramir</strong> — refuses it (quality of mercy)</p></li><li><p><strong>Frodo</strong> — carries it but ultimately fails at the Crack of Doom</p></li><li><p><strong>Boromir</strong> — succumbs to temptation</p></li><li><p><strong>Gollum</strong> — totally enslaved</p></li></ol><h2>Writing Notes</h2><p>The Ring should feel heavier in the prose as the story progresses. Early scenes: Frodo barely notices it. Middle: it's a weight around his neck. Final approach to Mordor: it's crushing him. The physical weight is a metaphor for moral burden.</p>
