## The Ranger (3)
Aragorn in exile — hiding his true identity, serving the free peoples in secret. The reluctant king.

1. ==**The Ranger of the North**== #aragorn patrols the wilderness near #bree, watching for servants of the Enemy. Years of solitude, a broken sword, and a love left behind in #rivendell. He receives word from #gandalf: a hobbit is coming with something important.

   - The Rangers: unseen protectors of the Shire

   - The hobbits' suspicion — is this man dangerous?
   - The letter from Gandalf confirming his identity

   - "If by my life or death I can protect you, I will."
   - Elrond's challenge: earn the throne or lose Arwen forever
   - Boromir's resentment — "Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king."

6. ==**The Breaking at Amon Hen**== #boromir falls to the Ring's temptation and attacks #frodo. The #uruk_hai assault the Fellowship at #amon_hen. Boromir redeems himself defending #merry and #pippin, but is mortally wounded. "I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king."

   - "The hobbits are alive" — tracks leading into the forest

   - The White Rider — they mistake him for Saruman
   - "I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now, at the turn of the tide."
   - New hope — the war can be won
