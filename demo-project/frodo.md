## The Shire (3)
Frodo's ordinary world — a peaceful life in the Shire, unaware of the storm gathering in the East. Establishes what he stands to lose.

1. ==**A Long-Expected Party**== Bilbo's 111th birthday party in Hobbiton. Fireworks, speeches, and a vanishing act. Frodo inherits Bag End and a mysterious gold ring. #bilbo #hobbiton #bag_end #ring
   - Bilbo's speech: "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like"
   - Gandalf's unease about the Ring

   - Gandalf tests the Ring in fire — the inscription appears
   - Sam caught eavesdropping

3. Leaving the Shire — Frodo sells Bag End and sets out with Sam, Merry, and Pippin through the countryside. A black shape on the road behind them. #bag_end #sam #merry #pippin #nazgul

   - Farmer Maggot's mushrooms

## The Road to Rivendell (4)
The journey east — from comfort to peril. Frodo learns the world is far more dangerous than he imagined.

   - The river rises against the Nine

7. ==**The Council of Elrond**== At Rivendell, Elrond convenes a council of all free peoples. The debate over the One Ring — no one can wield it, it cannot be hidden, it must be destroyed in Mount Doom. "I will take it. I will take the Ring to Mordor." #rivendell #elrond #one_ring #mount_doom
