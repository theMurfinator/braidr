## The Grey Pilgrim (2)
Gandalf the Grey — wanderer, counselor, and keeper of secrets. He alone understands the full scope of the threat.

   - "I wish it need not have happened in my time." — "So do I."

4. ==**The Bridge of Khazad-dum**== In Moria, the Fellowship awakens the Balrog of Morgoth. Gandalf confronts it on the Bridge of Khazad-dum. He shatters the bridge — but the Balrog's whip drags him into the abyss. "Fly, you fools!" #moria #balrog #gandalf #khazad_dum
   - "This foe is beyond any of you."
   - The fall into darkness

5. The Battle in the Deep — Gandalf and the Balrog fall for ten days through the roots of the mountain, into sunless water and up the Endless Stair to the peak of Zirak-zigil. Gandalf slays the Balrog and dies. He is sent back. #gandalf #balrog #zirakzigil

   - "I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place"
   - Death, and a choice to return

## The White Rider (3)

The final gambit — orchestrating the end of the Third Age.

The Host of the West stands before Sauron's full army. Then the Ring is destroyed, and everything Sauron built falls to ruin. #gandalf #aragorn #black_gate #mordor #sauron #frodo
